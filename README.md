## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment:
   - Update `env.js` with your RPC endpoints and credentials (e.g., private key).
   - Adjust `constants.js` for chain IDs, contract addresses, gas settings, and other operational parameters.

3. Run the bot:

   ```bash
   node frontrun.js
   ```

## Configuration

- `env.js`: Sensitive runtime values such as RPC URLs and private keys. Keep this file secure and never commit secrets.
- `constants.js`: Network and application constants (e.g., router addresses, WETH/WBNB addresses, gas multipliers).

Feel free to reach out for implementation assistance or integration support.

## Security Notes

- Never commit private keys or credentials.
- Prefer environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
- Use dedicated wallets and risk controls when operating on mainnet.
